# Mastermind

This was my first coding in python. It runs the game 'Mastermind' in a command window. While games are not really the primary use of python, it was a fun exercise as I learned the language.

Game_log.pickle is a record of games played. Data on each game is saved off for both debugging and general curiosity.
